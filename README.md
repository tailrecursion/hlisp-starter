## Motivation, Project Goals

This project aims to address some of the causes of incidental complexity in
frontend (user interface) web development.

* **Too many disparate domains.**

  The programmer must manage too many tightly coupled, fundamentally
  incompatible subsystems: HTML markup, CSS rules, JavaScript behaviors/events,
  HTML templating tools, etc. The HTML itself may be generated by server
  side code that the programmer must write in yet another programming language.

  These domains do not have a common set of primitives, means of abstraction,
  or means of composition. This results in having no coherent _meaning_
  for entities in these systems: entities do not have a single identity or
  way to manage references to them, they can't be composed with each other
  in a uniform way.

  The primary technique for managing complexity is the use of modular code and
  the separation of concerns. The tight coupling of disparate domains torpedoes
  this approach. Concerns which may be orthogonal in one domain may not be
  orthogonal in one of the other domains. The ability to create more specific
  abstractions by composition of more general ones is greatly restricted.

  **Goal:** Single, unified set of primitives, means of abstraction, and
  means of composition.
  
* **Pervasive use of global references and shared, mutable state.**

  The lack of a common set of primitives or means of abstraction/composition
  dictates the use of global identifiers to pass information between
  domains. This could be setting the `id` attribute of an element, or it
  could be a more complicated selector-based mechanism.

  **Goal:** Unified namespace with lexical scope for all entities.

* **Callback based event handling.**

  The browser event handling system is designed around a callback
  mechanism. Callbacks generally have the void type (aside from those that
  return boolean false to cause side effects). Thus, there is no way to
  compose them, and they must rely entirely on side effects and shared state
  to perform their tasks.

  Event streams are not first-class entities, so there is no way to form
  abstractions around them. They can't be composed with each other. They can't
  be locally referenced. This forces even more shared state upton the system.

  **Goal:** Push-based event system, first-class event streams, and composable
  event handlers.

### Additional Requirements

* **Don't get rid of HTML.**

  Designers will need to work with HTML markup. The browser renders it. The
  elimination of HTML markup would necessarily introduce complexity in the
  form of an interface between the designer and the programmer, at the very
  least. So if possible, keep HTML markup as the primary means of building the
  front end DOM structure.

* **Simple to learn, minimal tooling to get started.**

  The system should be learnable by the motivated designer. They shouldn't have
  to be skilled programmers to use it. The system should expose useful
  functionality to the user without requiring a lot of boilerplate setup code.

* **Robust set of libraries.**

  It must be practical to build extensive libraries of modular code. This means
  some mechanism for managing references, namespaces, etc. Some way to
  distribute libraries and include them in projects is also key.

## Approach



# Development

Install [Leiningen2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen)

Install dependencies:

    lein deps

Start a server to serve the app on port 4000:

    script/serve

In another tab, you can start watcher-based ClojureScript compilation:

    script/autobuild

Visit [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) to see the app.

## Running a ClojureScript REPL

The ClojureScript REPL compiles ClojureScript forms into JavaScript locally
and sends them to the browser to be evaluated.

### Emacs

* `C-x d` to the `cljs-starter` directory
* `M-x set-variable`, and set the variable `inferior-lisp-program` to
  `script/cljsrepl`
* `M-x run-lisp` and you should see an inferior-lisp buffer running a
  ClojureScript REPL.
* Visit or reload [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) in
  the browser.

### Vi

* If you know of a good inferior lisp setup for vi I'd like to hear about it!

### Example Session

* Hlisp defines vars for all the DOM elements in the following namespaces:
  * Project HTML page namespaces.
  * The `hlisp.env` namespace.
* Hlisp nodes in the REPL are printed as lists.
* The REPL also prints hlisp nodes in the browser console as DOM elements.

```
ClojureScript:cljs.user> (in-ns 'hlisp.env)

ClojureScript:hlisp.env> (div {:id "main"} (h1 ($text "Hello, world!")) (p ($text "How do you do?")))
(div {:id "main"} (h1 ($text "Hello, world!")) (p ($text "How do you do?")))

ClojureScript:hlisp.env> (defn f [x] (div {:class "foo"} x))
#<function f(x){ ... }>

ClojureScript:hlisp.env> (f (p ($text "I am wrapped in a div?")))
(div {:class "foo"} (p ($text "I am wrapped in a div?")))

ClojureScript:hlisp.env> (def test1 (f (label ($text "Name:"))))
(div {:class "foo"} (label ($text "Name:")))

ClojureScript:hlisp.env> (test1 br (input {:type "text"}))
(div {:class "foo"} (label ($text "Name:")) br (input {:type "text"}))
```

## Configuration

Have a look at the `project.clj` file:

```clj

;; Leiningen Plugins
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; 1. lein-cljsbuild    To get a ClojureScript REPL going.
;; 2. lein-ring         To get a local dev server going.
;; 3. lein-hlisp        The hlisp compiler---produces main.js.
;; 
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Dependencies
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; 1. clojure           Goes without saying.
;; 2. compojure         For the dev server setup.
;; 3. hlisp-macros      Some handy Clojure macros to use in cljs.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Hlisp Configuration
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; 1. html-src          Directory containing the HTML source files.
;; 2. cljs-src          Directory containing cljs source files.
;; 3. html-out          Directory into which processed HTML and JS will go.
;; 4. base-dir          URL path of deployed HTML if HTML is not served from 
;;                      the document root.
;; 5. includes          Vector of JS files to prepend (in order) to main.js.
;; 6. cljsc-opts        ClojureScript compiler options.

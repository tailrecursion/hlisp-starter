# Rationale

The "hlisp" (everything needs a name) project aims to address perceived
problems confronting front-end user interface (UI) programmers. The goal is to
provide a basis for a robust development environment where complex structures
can be built by composing simpler structures such that the results can
themselves be composed to form even more complex things. A secondary goal is to
develop a more unified front-end code structure, to maximize the ability to
express the program functionally, and to minimize the complexity associated
with shared state and mutable data.

## Perceived Problems

I've started many projects with a clear view of the desired dynamic behaviors
and DOM structure, thinking to myself, "Ah, now I will leverage my experience
and this time I will do everything right. I will build a beautiful palace
of pure and clean code, and this time it won't balloon into a rigid morass
of imperative boilerplate." I begin work, and things seem to go well. But
little by little I always seem to find myself rewriting JavaScript code due
to seemingly trivial issues, such as differences in the DOM structure between
components. Every time this happens I ruminate on my predicament, refactor,
and continue&mdash;ultimately unsatisfied with the results. In a large project
there is always a tipping point that is reached where I lose control of the
code, and must abandon my pure clean code for pragmatic git-r-dun compromises.

Why does this happen? Here are some possible causes:

* Going back to [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/), the primitive objects,
  means of abstraction, and means of composition available to the various
  components of a front-end program are fundamentally incompatible.

# Development

Install [Leiningen2](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen)

Install dependencies:

    lein deps

Start a server to serve the app on port 4000:

    script/serve

In another tab, you can start watcher-based ClojureScript compilation:

    script/autobuild

Visit [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) to see the app.

## Running a ClojureScript REPL

The ClojureScript REPL compiles ClojureScript forms into JavaScript locally
and sends them to the browser to be evaluated.

### Emacs

* `C-x d` to the `cljs-starter` directory
* `M-x set-variable`, and set the variable `inferior-lisp-program` to
  `script/cljsrepl`
* `M-x run-lisp` and you should see an inferior-lisp buffer running a
  ClojureScript REPL.
* Visit or reload [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) in
  the browser.

### Vi

* If you know of a good inferior lisp setup for vi I'd like to hear about it!

### Example Session

* Hlisp defines vars for all the DOM elements in the following namespaces:
  * Project HTML page namespaces.
  * The `hlisp.env` namespace.
* Hlisp nodes in the REPL are printed as lists.
* The REPL also prints hlisp nodes in the browser console as DOM elements.

```
ClojureScript:cljs.user> (in-ns 'hlisp.env)

ClojureScript:hlisp.env> (div {:id "main"} (h1 ($text "Hello, world!")) (p ($text "How do you do?")))
(div {:id "main"} (h1 ($text "Hello, world!")) (p ($text "How do you do?")))

ClojureScript:hlisp.env> (defn f [x] (div {:class "foo"} x))
#<function f(x){ ... }>

ClojureScript:hlisp.env> (f (p ($text "I am wrapped in a div?")))
(div {:class "foo"} (p ($text "I am wrapped in a div?")))

ClojureScript:hlisp.env> (def test1 (f (label ($text "Name:"))))
(div {:class "foo"} (label ($text "Name:")))

ClojureScript:hlisp.env> (test1 br (input {:type "text"}))
(div {:class "foo"} (label ($text "Name:")) br (input {:type "text"}))
```

## Configuration

Have a look at the `project.clj` file:

```clj
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Leiningen Plugins
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; 1. lein-cljsbuild    To get a ClojureScript REPL going.
;; 2. lein-ring         To get a local dev server going.
;; 3. lein-hlisp        The hlisp compiler---produces main.js.
;; 
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Dependencies
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; 1. clojure           Goes without saying.
;; 2. compojure         For the dev server setup.
;; 3. hlisp-macros      Some handy Clojure macros to use in cljs.
;;
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Hlisp Configuration
;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;
;; 1. html-src          Directory containing the HTML source files.
;; 2. cljs-src          Directory containing cljs source files.
;; 3. html-out          Directory into which processed HTML and JS will go.
;; 4. base-dir          URL path of deployed HTML if HTML is not served from 
;;                      the document root.
;; 5. includes          Vector of JS files to prepend (in order) to main.js.
;; 6. cljsc-opts        ClojureScript compiler options.
